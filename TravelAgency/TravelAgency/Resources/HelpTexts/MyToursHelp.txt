This page is divided in two sections.

First, upper section is showing if there is active tour now, that you have reserved.

If there is not it will be just saying "There is currently no active tour".

If there is, it will show which tour is active and your status (have you arrived or not).

Also it will show where is the tour at the moment, so you can see where is it if you haven't arrived yet.

Second section is showing all the tours you've been on.

To see more detailed view of one tour click more details button on the right side of appropriate row.

To rate the tour select one tour from the table and click on rate the tour button on the bottom.

Tour can be rated only once.
